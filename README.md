# Stock-Market-Forecasting
🚀 The project applied advanced machine learning techniques to analyze global stock markets, identify top-performing industries, and forecast stock price trends up to 2030. Major indices such as NASDAQ (IXIC), NYSE Composite (NYA) were analyzed to uncover actionable insights and predict long-term market behavior.

🔍Key Insights:
Forecasted stock price movements up to 2030 using XGBoost Regression, leveraging time-series features such as lag variables and rolling statistics to capture temporal dependencies
Clustered industries using K-means clustering to reveal relationships between trading volume and price volatility:
High Volume, Low Price Change (e.g., NASDAQ)
Low Volume, High Price Change (e.g., Nikkei 225)
Moderate Volume and Price Change (e.g., NIFTY 50)
Highlighted the dominance of technology and commodity-driven industries, driven by factors such as AI advancements and green energy investments.
Machine Learning & Technical Highlights:
Predictive Modeling:
Fine-tuned XGBoost Regression models using grid search to optimize hyperparameters like n_estimators, learning_rate, and max_depth.
Achieved robust performance validated through metrics such as RMSE and MAE.
Time-Series Forecasting:
Engineered lagged features and rolling averages to enhance model prediction capabilities.
Forecasted weekly and monthly stock prices, enabling reliable long-term market trend predictions.
Clustering & Analysis:

Applied K-means clustering with scaled features to segment industries based on trading volume and price changes.
Removed outliers using Z-score filtering for improved clustering accuracy.
Advanced Visualizations:

Developed industry-specific time-series plots and clustered scatterplots using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Created dashboards to visualize predicted vs. actual stock prices and highlight growth trends across industries.
 💡This project deepened my expertise in time-series forecasting, ML, and financial data analytics, providing actionable insights for stakeholders.
